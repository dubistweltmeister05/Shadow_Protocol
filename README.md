## 📡 Overview

A lightweight, military-grade\* HTTP server implementation built from the ground up using Windows Sockets (Winsock2). This project demonstrates core networking concepts through a minimalist server that responds to incoming connections with a tactical acknowledgment.

> \*Note: Not actually military-grade, but we can pretend!

## 🎯 Features

- **Pure C Implementation**: No fancy frameworks, just raw socket programming
- **Windows-Compatible**: Built specifically for Windows using Winsock2
- **Tactical Response System**: Responds to all requests with a classified\* message
- **Minimalist Architecture**: Clean, straightforward codebase
- **Educational Value**: Perfect for understanding network programming basics

> \*Message classification level: Unclassified

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- C Compiler (GCC, MSVC, etc.)
- Basic understanding of TCP/IP (or a willingness to learn)

### Compilation

```bash
# Using GCC
gcc server.c test.c -o dark_eagle.exe -lws2_32

# Using MSVC
cl server.c test.c /link ws2_32.lib
```

### Deployment

1. Launch the executable:

```bash
./dark_eagle.exe
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Project Structure

├── server.h # Server structure and function declarations
├── server.c # Core server implementation
└── test.c # Server initialization and request handling

```

### Core Components

#### Server Structure

```c
struct server {
    int domain;            // Protocol family (AF_INET)
    int service;           // Socket type (SOCK_STREAM)
    int protocol;          // Protocol (TCP)
    u_long iface;          // Network interface
    int port;              // Operating port
    int backlog;           // Connection queue size
    struct sockaddr_in address;  // Socket address configuration
    SOCKET socket;         // Socket handle
    void (*launch)(struct server *server);  // Launch procedure
};
```

### Network Specifications

- **Protocol**: HTTP/1.1
- **Default Port**: 8080
- **Socket Type**: TCP (SOCK_STREAM)
- **Address Family**: IPv4 (AF_INET)
- **Backlog Size**: 10 connections

## 🛠️ Customization

### Changing the Port

Modify the port number in `test.c`:

```c
struct server my_server = serverconstructor(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0, INADDR_ANY, YOUR_PORT, 10, launch);
```

### Modifying the Response

Update the tactical message in `test.c`:

```c
char *hello = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
             "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n"
             "Content-Length: YOUR_LENGTH\r\n"
             "\r\n"
             "YOUR_MESSAGE";
```

## 🎮 Usage Scenarios

## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### Connection Flow

1. **Initialization Phase**

   ```
   WSAStartup() → Socket Creation → Bind → Listen
   ```

2. **Operation Phase**
   ```
   Accept Connection → Receive Request → Send Response → Close Connection
   ```

### Memory Management

- Static buffer size: 500KB
- Stack-based memory allocation
- Automatic cleanup on connection close

### Error Handling

- WSA error code reporting
- Socket creation validation
- Connection acceptance verification

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Tactical Upgrades**

   - Multiple connection handling
   - Dynamic response generation
   - Encrypted communications
   - Stealth mode operations

2. **Technical Improvements**

   - Request parsing
   - HTTP method handling
   - Header management
   - Connection pooling

3. **Security Features**
   - TLS/SSL support
   - Request validation
   - Rate limiting
   - Access control

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. Single-connection handling
2. Fixed response message
3. Basic HTTP implementation
4. No request parsing
5. Limited error recovery
